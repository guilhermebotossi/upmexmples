Caused by: java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving field "DATETIME" the class loader


Solution:

The error occurred due to a conflicts between the class provided by the weblogic and the jaxb-impl.jar packaged within ear file.

I added the jax-impl dependency in pom as 'provided' scope so that its excluded from packaging. The container provided classes are used then.

<dependency>
                <groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
                  <artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
                  <version>2.3.1</version>
                  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
